Initial Lesson, Setup your environment.


## Install Node.js
Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and install the latest version on Node.js, which should also install Node Package Manager (NPM).

## Create React App
Visit https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html for a tutorial on how to get started with create-react-app.

Work through the ["Create React App"](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) section. This will scaffold out a demo application and be the base for a new project. When complete, you will have a simple single page application (SPA) and a local web server that produces a site with the react logo.
