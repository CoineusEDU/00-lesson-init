Initial Lesson, Setup your environment.


## Install Node.js
Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and install the latest version on Node.js, which should also install Node Package Manager (NPM).

## Create React App
Visit https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html for a tutorial on how to get started with create-react-app.

Work through the ["Create React App"](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) section. This will scaffold out a demo application and be the base for a new project. When complete, you will have a simple single page application (SPA) and a local web server that produces a site with the react logo.


## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
You can use a simple text editor like notepad or textedit to modify your code. However an IDE has advanced features to simplify development and provides tools to speed up the process.

I personally use Webstorm from Jetbrains, https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/, it costs $69 for the first year.

Some free options include:

- Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
- Atom: https://ide.atom.io/

## Git using GitHub Desktop
All lessons will be instructed over GitHub, a git as a service platform owned by Microsoft. You can use the command line tools of git to perform all the needed actions, as well as some built in tools of some IDEs, however we will use GitHub Desktop to demo the steps required. 

Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
